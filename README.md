ZHIPUAI_API_KEY=Your_Key npx exif-ai -i example.jpeg -a zhipu
```

## Install

```bash
npm install -g exif-ai
```

## API Providers

Exif AI requires an API provider to generate description from image. Currently we have only one builtin provider ZhipuAI.
You should have a ZhipuAI API
 key before using Exif AI.

You can also build your own provider by implementing the provider interface.
